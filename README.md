# Angular Playground

This project is a playground to try to implement and show some Angular development good practices.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

The app also needs the backend API to run. It is strongly recommended to run the API mock by running `npm run start-api-mock`. The API is run using [Mockoon](https://mockoon.com).

API mock can then be stopped by running `npm run stop-api-mock`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Lint the code

Run `npm run lint` to run the linters.

It is often possible to fix trivial errors by running `npm run fix`. The remaining errors must be fixed manually.

## Running unit tests

Run `npm run test` to execute the unit tests via [Jest](https://jestjs.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Further help
